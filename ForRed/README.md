"In the darkness of the night, LED-lit flowers, opening as if dancing to a soft melody, slowly change colors, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of a fairy tale. With the gentle breeze, robotic flowers slowly open and close, enchanting with their graceful movements that mimic the rhythm of nature. Designed with biomimicry, flowers optimize their sun-following leaves to gather energy, symbolizing the green energy of the modern world."
